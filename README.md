# 🩺 Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based project to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on medical diagnostic data.

## 🚀 Overview

This project uses a supervised learning approach to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis using accessible health data and improve healthcare efficiency.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

> The models were trained and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Attributes:** 768 samples, 8 features (e.g., Glucose, BMI, Age, etc.)

## 📊 Features

- Glucose Level
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
